The following Terms and Conditions ("Terms") govern the sale of the cryptographic token — FundRequest Token ("FND") — to purchasers of FND ("Purchasers" collectively, and "Purchaser" individually).
The FundRequest Platform is being developed by a volunteer contributor team, and will continue to be developed on a volunteer basis by some developers as well as under a more formalised contracting or employment relationship for other developers.

This document is not a solicitation for investment and does not pertain in any way to an offering of securities in any jurisdiction. Participation in the crowdsale will not provide you with a "security" or "equity" stake in this project. The ownership of FND Tokens is a reward based return and not intended to be any form of loan based return. The digital token known as "FND" is only useful for identifying your contribution to the crowdsale. If the platform is successful, owners of FND tokens will be receiving gifts of ETH in acknowledgement of their support.
This document describes the FundRequest ICO Sale in which the cryptographic token ("FND") is sold, as well as the initial creation of the token. Parties may be interested in purchasing FND (the token) in the FundRequest ICO Sale to support the development of the FundRequest Platform. Individuals, businesses, and other organisations should carefully weigh the risks, costs, and benefits of acquiring the token early in the FundRequest ICO Sale versus waiting to purchase FND on open, third-party exchanges once the system is operational.

## IMPORTANT
Ownership of FND carries no rights expressed or implied. Purchases of FND are non-refundable. Purchasers should have no expectation of influence over governance of the platform.
By participating in the sale of FND, you acknowledge and represent that you have carefully reviewed the Terms and fully understand the risks, costs, and benefits of purchasing FND and agree to be bound by these Terms. As set forth further below, you further represent and warrant that, to the extent permitted by law, you are authorised to purchase FND in your relevant jurisdiction, are of a legal age to be bound by these Terms, and will not hold FundRequest, its parent and affiliates, and the officers, directors, agents, joint ventures, employees, developers, volunteers and suppliers of FundRequest or our parent or affiliates, now or in the future and any other member of the FundRequest Team (collectively all people who contribute to the FundRequest platform) liable for any losses or any special, incidental, or consequential damages arising out of, or in any way connected to the sale of FND.

> WARNING: DO NOT PURCHASE FND IF YOU ARE NOT AN EXPERT IN DEALING WITH CRYPTOGRAPHIC TOKENS AND BLOCKCHAIN-BASED SOFTWARE SYSTEMS

Purchases of FND should be undertaken only by individuals, entities, or companies that have significant experience with, and understanding of, the usage and intricacies of cryptographic tokens, like bitcoin (BTC), and blockchain-based software systems.

While the FundRequest Team will provide general guidelines for user usage and storage of FND before the FundRequest Platform becomes operational, Purchasers should have functional understanding of storage and transmission mechanisms associated with other cryptographic tokens. While the FundRequest Team will be available to assist Purchasers of FND during and after the sale, FundRequest will not be responsible for lost ETH or FND resulting from actions taken by, or omitted by Purchasers. Note, in particular, that FND Purchasers should take great care to write down their wallet password and not lose it so as to be sure that they will be able to access their FND.

If you do not have such experience or expertise, then you should not purchase FND.

WARNING: CRYPTOGRAPHIC TOKENS OF VALUE MAY EXPERIENCE EXTREME VOLATILITY IN PRICING
Cryptographic tokens that possess value in public markets, such as BTC, have demonstrated extreme fluctuations in price over short periods of time on a regular basis. A Purchaser of FND should be prepared to expect similar fluctuations, both down and up, in the price of FND denominated in ETH or United States dollars ("USD") or other fiat money of other jurisdictions. Such fluctuations are due to market forces and represent changes in the balance of supply and demand. FundRequest cannot and does not guarantee market liquidity for FND and therefore there may be periods of time in which FND is difficult to buy. Additionally, due to different regulatory dictates in different jurisdictions and the inability of citizens of certain countries to open accounts at exchanges located anywhere in the world, the liquidity of FND may be markedly different in different countries and this would likely be reflected in significant price discrepancies. Please understand that this project is in its early days of development and that the market for these tokens will be very shallow and thus make it will be harder to buy and sell these tokens without effecting the price on the market.
By purchasing FND, you expressly acknowledge and represent that you fully understand that FND may experience volatility in pricing and will not seek to hold any of the FundRequest Parties liable for any losses or any special, incidental, or consequential damages arising from, or in any way connected to the sale of FND.
WARNING: THE PURCHASE OF FND HAS A NUMBER OF RISKS
The purchase of FND carries with it a number of risks. Prior to purchasing FND, you should carefully consider the risks listed below and, to the extent necessary, consult an appropriate lawyer, accountant, or tax professional. If any of the following risks are unacceptable to you, you should not purchase FND. By purchasing FND, and to the extent permitted by law, you are agreeing not to hold any of the FundRequest Parties liable for any losses or any special, incidental, or consequential damages arising from, or in any way connected, to the sale of FND, including losses associated with the risks set forth below.
Obligation to Determine If Purchaser Can Purchase FND in Purchaser's Jurisdiction

The FundRequest ICO Sale constitutes the sale of a legal software product under Belgium law. This product sale is conducted by FundRequest, a Belgium organisation, operating under Belgium law. It is the responsibility of each potential Purchaser of FND to determine if the Purchaser can legally purchase FND in the Purchaser's jurisdiction.
Acceptance of Terms and Conditions of the FND Sale

As a first step in the purchase process, FundRequest will present the Purchaser with these Terms, and any other associated documents, along with a checkbox. By clicking the checkbox, the Purchaser: (info) consents and agrees to the Terms and the FundRequest Token Product Purchase Agreement; (ii) represents and warrants that the Purchaser is legally permitted to purchase FND in the Purchaser's jurisdiction and is legally permitted to receive products of Belgian origin (iii) represents and warrants that the Purchaser is of a sufficient age to legally purchase FND or has received permission from a legal guardian who has reviewed and agreed to these Terms; (iv) represents and warrants that the the Purchaser will take sole responsibility for any restrictions and risks associated with the purchase of FND as set forth below; (v) represents and warrants that Purchaser is not exchanging Ether (ETH) for FND for the purpose of speculative investment; (vi) represents and warrants that the Purchaser is acquiring FND for supporting the development of a platform for supporting open source contributions, or to facilitate development, testing, deployment and operation of decentralised applications on the Ethereum Platform; and (vii) represents and warrants that the Purchaser has an understanding of the usage and intricacies of cryptographic tokens, like BTC, and blockchain-based software systems.
Independent Confirmation of Purchases

During the purchase process on the https://www.fundrequest.io website, FundRequest will provide Purchasers with a unique intermediary ETH address. Using this address, Purchasers can track and confirm that the Purchaser's ETH has been received at that address.
Knowledge of the unique intermediary ETH address does not constitute a purchase receipt or indicate in any way that any party possessing such knowledge has rights to or ownership of the purchased FND.
Loss of the Purchase Password Will Cause the Loss of the Purchased FND

As part of the purchase process, and in order to purchase FND, the Purchaser will need to provide an ETH address. The Purchaser ETH address will be used to send the FND token to. The Purchaser ETH address will store the purchased FND.
Purchaser must keep the Purchase ETH address Password safe and not share it in any way or with anybody. The Purchase ETH address Password is essential for accessing the Purchaser's FND. Purchaser's loss of the Purchase ETH address Password will cause the loss of the purchased FND. Unauthorised access by any party to a Purchaser's ETH address Password along with access to the Ethereum wallet, will enable that unauthorised party to access the purchased FND and the FND will be lost.
By purchasing FND, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, the Purchaser agrees not to hold any of the FundRequest Parties liable for any losses or any special, incidental, or consequential damages arising out of, or in any way connected to, Purchaser's failure to properly secure and keep private the Purchaser's ETH address Password and/or the Purchaser's Ethereum wallet.
FND Will Only Be Available For Sale on the FundRequest Website

FundRequest will only sell FND through the FundRequest website, available at https://www.fundrequest.io. To the extent that any third-party website or service offers FND for sale during the FundRequest ICO Sale or facilitates the sale or transfer of FND in any way during the FundRequest ICO Sale, such third-party websites or services are not sanctioned by FundRequest or its parents and affiliates and have no relationship in any way with the FundRequest Parties. As a result, FundRequest prohibits the use of these third-party websites or services for the purchase of FND prior to the end of the FundRequest ICO Sale.
Purchasers should take great care to ensure that the URL of your web browser indicates that it is using a hypertext transport protocol secure connection ("https") and that the domain name is correct.
By purchasing FND, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, the Purchaser agrees not hold any of the FundRequest Parties liable for losses incurred by any person, entity, corporation, or group individuals or groups who uses a third party service to purchase FND.
The only official and authorised FND sale website URL is https://www.fundrequest.io
Fraudulent Attempts to Double Spend ETH

FundRequest will monitor all potential transactions for fraudulent attempts to double spend ETH. Any detected double spend of ETH will result in no FND being transferred the associated wallet address.
FundRequest Will Not Purchase FND During ICO Sale

FundRequest warrants that it will not purchase FND in its own sale. Furthermore FundRequest warrants that it will not purchase FND from any third party, or acquire FND in any manner, or acquire future control of FND, during and one year after the period of the FundRequest ICO Sale.
Certain Risks Associated with the Purchase of FND

The purchase of FND carries with it significant risk. Prior to purchasing FND, the Purchaser should carefully consider the below risks and, to the extent necessary, consult a lawyer, accountant, and/or tax professionals prior to determining whether to purchase FND.
Risk of Dissolution of The FundRequest Project Due To a Diminishment in the Value of the ETH Sale Revenue

All Purchasers are paying ETH to purchase FND. In the past few months the price of ETH in USD and EUR has been relatively stable. However, despite recent price stability, it is possible that the value of ETH will drop significantly in the future, depriving FundRequest of sufficient resources to continue to operate. In order to guard against this risk, FundRequest intends to periodically convert proceeds from the sale of FND into fiat currencies instead of ETH. In order to cover the initial startup costs, FundRequest will convert 150.000 USD worth of Ether to fiat after a successful crowdsale.
Risk of Losing Access to FND Due to Loss of a Wallet File or Password

As noted above, FND will be stored in a wallet, which can only be accessed with a password selected by the Purchaser. If a Purchaser of FND does not maintain an accurate record of the Purchaser's password or losses the wallet, this will lead to the loss of FND.
As a result, Purchasers must safely store their password and the wallet in one or more backup locations that are well separated from the primary location. Additionally the password and the wallet should never be stored together.
In order to access one's FND, both the wallet and the password that the Purchaser entered are required; loss of either, or leakage/theft of both, will lead to the loss of a Purchaser's FND.
Risk of Unauthorised Access to a Wallet

Any third party that gains access to the Purchaser's Ethereum wallet and potentially access the wallet by deciphering or cracking the Purchaser's password. To guard against any improper access to the wallet, the Purchaser should select a highly secure Purchase Password for the Purchaser's FND wallet.
Purchaser must take care not to respond to any inquiry regarding their purchase of FND, including but not limited to, email requests purportedly coming from the fundrequest.io or similar looking domain.
Risk of Regulatory Action in One or More Jurisdictions

Cryptocurrencies have been the subject of regulatory scrutiny by various regulatory bodies around the globe. The FundRequest Platform and FND could be impacted by one or more regulatory inquiries or regulatory action, which could impede or limit the ability FundRequest Team to continue to develop the FundRequest Platform.
Risk of Insufficient Interest in the FundRequest Platform

It is possible that the FundRequest Platform will not be used by a large number of external businesses, individuals, and other organisations and that there will be limited public interest in supporting the open source community via our platform. Such a lack of interest could impact the development of the FundRequest Platform. FundRequest has contracted with developers to help build the FundRequest Platform and is working with other third-party developers around the world to create an interest in the FundRequest Platform. However, it cannot predict the success of its own development efforts or the efforts of other third parties.
Risk Associated With the Development of Other Platforms like FundRequest

FundRequest is one of a few organisations, companies, and groups, attempting to build a platform for rewarding ppen source contributions. It is possible that different technical paradigms than the ones being used in the current FundRequest Platform implementation are optimal.
While FundRequest anticipates being a leader in the development of such a platform, competition from these alternative platforms may impact success of the FundRequest Project and the ability of FundRequest to operate.
Risk that the FundRequest Platform, As Developed, Will Not Meet the Expectations of Purchaser

The Purchaser recognises that the FundRequest Platform is presently under development and may undergo significant changes before release. Purchaser acknowledges that any expectations regarding the form and functionality of the FundRequest Platform held by the Purchaser may not be met upon release of the FundRequest Platform, for any number of reasons including a change in the design and implementation plans and execution of the implementation of the FundRequest Platform.
Risk that the FundRequest Platform May Never be Completed or Released

Purchaser understands, that while the FundRequest Team will make reasonable efforts to complete the FundRequest software, it is possible that an official completed version of the FundRequest Platform may not be released and there may never be an operational FundRequest Platform.
Risk of Theft

Hackers or other groups or organisations may attempt to steal the ETH revenue from the FundRequest ICO Sale, thus potentially impacting the ability of FundRequest to develop the FundRequest Platform and operate FundRequest. To account for this risk, FundRequest has and will continue to implement comprehensive security precautions to safeguard the ETH obtained from the sale of FND.
Risk of Security Weaknesses in the FundRequest Platform Software

The FundRequest Platform rests on ppen source software, and there is a risk that the FundRequest Team, or other third parties not directly affiliated with the FundRequest Parties, may introduce weaknesses or bugs into the core infrastructural elements of the FundRequest Platform causing the system to lose ETH or FND stored in one or more Purchaser accounts or other accounts or lose sums of other valued tokens issued on the FundRequest Platform.
FundRequest has taken steps to build, maintain, and secure the infrastructure of the FundRequest Platform, and will continue to do so after the FundRequest ICO Sale.
Risk of Weaknesses or Exploitable Breakthroughs in the Field of Cryptography

Cryptography is an art, not a science. And the state of the art can advance over time Advances in code cracking, or technical advances such as the development of quantum computers, could present risks to cryptocurrencies and the FundRequest Platform, which could result in the theft or loss of ETH or FND. To the extent possible, FundRequest intends to update the protocol underlying the FundRequest Platform to account for any advances in cryptography and to incorporate additional security measures, but cannot it cannot predict the future of cryptography or the success of any future security updates..
Risk of Ether Mining Attacks

As with other cryptocurrencies, the blockchain used for the FundRequest Platform, Ethereum is susceptible to mining attacks, including but not limited to double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks, "selfish-mining" attacks, and race condition attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to the FundRequest Platform, expected proper execution and sequencing of ETH transactions, and expected proper execution and sequencing of contract computations. Despite the efforts of the Ethereum community, known or novel mining attacks may be successful.
Risk of Rapid Adoption and Insufficiency of Computational Application Processing Power on the FundRequest Network

If the FundRequest Platform is rapidly adopted, the demand for transaction processing could rise dramatically and at a pace that exceeds the supporting rate. Under such a scenario, the entire FundRequest Platform could become destabilised.
All Purchases of FundRequest tokens (FND) Are Non-Refundable

ALL PURCHASES OF FND TOKENS ARE FINAL. PURCHASES OF FND ARE NON-REFUNDABLE. BY PURCHASING FND, THE PURCHASER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT NEITHER FUNDREQUEST NOR ANY OTHER OF THE FUNDREQUEST PARTIES ARE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A REFUND FOR ANY REASON, AND THAT THE PURCHASER WILL NOT RECEIVE MONEY OR OTHER COMPENSATION FOR ANY FND. ONCE THE PURCHASER RECEIVES HIS OR HER TOKENS AFTER THE CROWDSALE, THEY ARE FREE TO SEND OR SELL THEM TO ANYONE OF THEIR CHOICE.
Taxation of FND token and Taxation Related to the FundRequest ICO Sale

FundRequest makes no representations concerning the tax implications of the sale of FND or the possession or use of FND. The Purchaser bears the sole responsibility to determine if the purchase of FND with ETH or the potential appreciation or depreciation in the value of FND over time has tax implications for the Purchaser in the Purchaser's home jurisdiction.
Purchasing FND, and to the extent permitted by law, the Purchaser agrees not hold any of the FundRequest Parties liable for any tax liability associated with or arising from the purchase of FND.
Privacy

Although FundRequest requires that Purchasers provide an Ethereum address, FundRequest will not publish any identifying information related to an FND purchase, without the prior written consent of the Purchaser.
Purchasers may be contacted by email by FundRequest regarding a purchase. Such emails will be informational only. FundRequest will not request any information from Purchasers in an email.

Dispute Resolution

All disputes, controversies or claims arising out of, relating to, or in connection with the Terms, the breach thereof, or FundRequest's sale of FND or use of the FundRequest Platform shall be finally settled under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce by one or more arbitrators appointed in accordance with said Rules. All claims between the parties relating to these Terms that are capable of being resolved by arbitration, whether sounding in contract, tort, or otherwise, shall be submitted to ICC arbitration.
Prior to commencing arbitration, the parties have a duty to negotiate in good faith and attempt to resolve their dispute in a manner other than by submission to ICC arbitration.
The arbitration panel shall consist of one arbitrator only, unless the ICC Court of Arbitration determines that the dispute is such as to warrant three arbitrators. If the Court determines that one arbitrator is sufficient, then such arbitrator shall be selected from Belgium. If the Court determines that three arbitrators are necessary, then each party shall have 30 days to nominate an arbitrator of its choice — in the case of the Claimant, measured from receipt of notification of the ICC Court's decision to have three arbitrators; in the case of Respondent, measured from receipt of notification of Claimant's nomination. All nominations must be from Belgium. If a party fails to nominate an arbitrator, the Court will do so. The Court shall also appoint the chairman.
All arbitrators shall be and remain "independent" of the parties involved in the arbitration. The place of arbitration shall be fixed by the ICC Court, but the arbitral tribunal may conduct hearings, meetings, and deliberations at any location it considers appropriate. The language of the arbitration shall be English. In deciding the merits of the dispute, the tribunal shall apply the laws of Belgium and any discovery shall be limited and shall not involve any depositions or any other examinations outside of a formal hearing. The tribunal shall not assume the powers of amiable compositor or decide the case ex aequo et bono.
In the final award, the tribunal shall fix the costs of the arbitration and decide which of the parties shall bear such costs in what proportion. Every award shall be binding on the parties. The parties undertake to carry out the award without delay and waive their right to any form of recourse against the award in so far as such waiver can validly be made.
Force Majeure

FundRequest is not liable for failure to perform solely caused by:
unavoidable casualty, delays in delivery of materials, embargoes, government orders, acts of civil or military authorities, acts by common carriers, emergency conditions (including weather conditions) incompatible with safety or good quality workmanship, or any similar unforeseen event that renders performance commercially implausible. If an event of force majeure occurs, the party injured by the other's inability to perform may elect to suspend the Agreement, in whole or part, for the duration of the force majeure circumstances. The party experiencing the force majeure circumstances shall cooperate with and assist the injured party in all reasonable ways to minimise the impact of force majeure on the injured party.
Complete Agreement

These Terms sets forth the entire understanding between each Purchaser and FundRequest with respect to the purchase and sale of FND.
For facts relating to the sale and purchase, the Purchaser agrees to rely only on this document in determining purchase decisions and understands that this document govern the sale of FND and supersede any public statements about the FundRequest ICO Sale made by third parties or by FundRequest Team or individuals associated with any FundRequest Parties, past and present and during the FundRequest ICO Sale.
Severability

The Purchaser and FundRequest agree that if any portion of these Terms is found illegal or unenforceable, in whole or in part, the Terms will be ineffective solely to the extent of such determination of invalidity without affecting the validity or enforceability thereof in any other manner or jurisdiction and without affecting the remaining provisions of the Terms, which shall continue to be in full force and effect.
No Waiver

The failure of FundRequest to require or enforce strict performance by the Purchaser of any provision of these Terms or FundRequest's failure to exercise any right under these agreements shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment of FundRequest's right to assert or rely upon any such provision or right in that or any other instance.
The express waiver by FundRequest of any provision, condition, or requirement of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of any future obligation to comply with such provision, condition or requirement.
Except as expressly and specifically set forth in this these Terms, no representations, statements, consents, waivers, or other acts or omissions by FundRequest shall be deemed a modification of these Terms nor be legally binding, unless documented in physical writing, hand signed by the Purchaser and a duly appointed officer, employee, or agent of FundRequest.
Updates to the Terms and Conditions of the FundRequest ICO Sale

FundRequest reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions of the Terms at any time during the sale by posting the amended Terms on the FundRequest website (https://www.fundrequest.io). Any Purchaser will be deemed to have accepted such changes by purchasing FND.
The Terms may not be otherwise amended except in a signed writing executed by both the Purchaser and FundRequest. For purposes of this agreement, "writing" does not include an e-mail message and a signature does not include an electronic signature.
If at any point you do not agree to any portion of the then-current version of the Terms, you should not purchase FND.
To the extent the Terms conflict with the FND Product Purchase Agreement, the Terms shall govern.
Cooperation with Legal Authorities

FundRequest will cooperate with all law enforcement inquiries, subpoenas, or requests provided they are fully supported and documented by the law in the relevant jurisdictions. In accord with one of the core principles of the FundRequest project — transparency — FundRequest will endeavour to publish any legal inquiries upon receipt.
