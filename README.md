# Introduction to Diplr

Diplr is an ecosystem that is being created aimed to provide an easy to use platform for people, companies and applications to register, verify and interact with intellectual property in general.

## What we consider as intellectual property

Intellectual property is a broad concept. What intellectual property means to us, might mean something else to you. To understand what it means to us, we start from the official definition and expand on it to make it suit the needs of what we think intellectual property should be. 

> Intellectual property (IP) refers to creations of the intellect for which a monopoly is assigned to designated owners by law. Intellectual property rights (IPRs) are the rights granted to the creators of IP, and include trademarks, copyright, patents, industrial design rights, and in some jurisdictions trade secrets. Artistic works including music and literature, as well as discoveries, inventions, words, phrases, symbols, and designs can all be protected as intellectual property.

We think this definition is quite clear, but there's one thing that stands out that we'd like to see changed. 

**By Law**

The fact that intellectual property is defined *by law* is something we find worying. A lot of questions arise. 

- Who's law?
- What are de procedures to identify intellectual property?
- Who defines who owns a piece of intellectual property? 
- How is intellectual property registered?
- Is *the law* the only way to formally verify the registration of intellectual property?

**Here comes distributed trust**

What if there is a way to trustlessly register and verify intellectual property? Can we really formally trust **an entity** with registering and verifying IP? 

Blockchain is more than just distributed technology. It implies trust in every sense of the word. By relying on blockchain technologies we can cut out the entities which are **believed** to be trusted with your intellectual property. We can actually have a technology which can be **trusted** with the formal verification process.

We believe blockchain technology can disrupt the entire industry.

We believe blockchain technology can change the way people think about intellectual property.
