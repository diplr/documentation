# What Diplr can mean for the industry

## Here comes distributed trust

What if there is a way to trustlessly register and verify intellectual property? Can we really formally trust **an entity** with registering and verifying IP? 

Blockchain is more than just distributed technology. It implies trust in every sense of the word. By relying on blockchain technologies we can cut out the entities which are **believed** to be trusted with your intellectual property. We can actually have a technology which can be **trusted** with the formal verification process.

We believe blockchain technology can disrupt the entire industry.

We believe blockchain technology can change the way people think about intellectual property.
